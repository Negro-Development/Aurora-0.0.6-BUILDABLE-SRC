## Building
in order to build the jar, just go to the directory where u extracted the files and do `gradlew build` on the terminal <br>
then the jar will be on `build/libs/xxxxxxxxx.jar`<br>
then u put it on the `mods` folder (.minecraft) and load it (-noverify JVM args may be wanted)


# Lore
- smx (original dev) challenged me to deobfuscate and remap his giantic client
- i accepted the challenge
- he said he was going to pay 150 BRL for me
- i started analyzing the client
- i started writing my own custom deobfuscator (with lot of skidfuscator remaps) and its own remapper (with ma friend)
- it worked
- i sent the dev some work progress
- the dev didnt believed
- i started making a buildable src for it
- it also worked
- ma friend did a speedrun video deobf&remapping it
- he posted
- i posted the buildable src
- we all good
